Map, Filter, Reduce - Code Exercises

[Link dos exerc√≠cios](https://www.crocoder.dev/blog/map-filter-reduce-exercises/#get-name-initials)

It's really hard to test your programming knowledge after you have completed a tutorial or a lecture. We have prepared some exercises to help out beginner devs to solidify their understanding of Map, Filter, Reduce, and other useful array methods. Every exercise has a brief description of the problem, starting code, links to relevant MDN docs, and expected results. Try to solve the problems without taking a peek at the solution.

If you need some additional help, you can check out our Arrays video from #lockdown learning series in which we discuss Map, Filter and Reduce or contact the author of the article directly.

As a JavaScript developer, you will come across arrays. Arrays of numbers, arrays of objects, arrays of arrays of objects, multi-dimensional arrays, and you will need to simplify, transform or manipulate them.

You could use 'nested for loops' to solve most of the problems you will encounter, but that leaves the code hard to read and understand.

I would like to prove to you that by using Map, Filter, and Reduce array methods, not only will the code be more readable, but you will also be able to analyze the problem better and write the code with ease.
